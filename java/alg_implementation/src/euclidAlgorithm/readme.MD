**Euclid's Algorithm**

_To find the GCD to two positive integer_

Algorithm:
Consider two positive integer m and n, such that m >n.<br>
`Step1:` Divide m by n and let the reminder be r.<br>
`step2:` If r=0, the algorithm ends, n is the GCD.<br>
`step3.` Set, m->n, n->r and go back to step 1 and continue.<br>
